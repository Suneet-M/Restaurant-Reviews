## Restaurant Reviews
This project was made as part of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree course.\
Its a simple app that lists restaurants and shows their location on the map. The restaurants can be filtered according to the neighborhood and cuisine.\
The restaurants are listed below in cards which give you a glance at the restaurant interior and address.\
Each card has a button to redirect you to the restaurant detail page.\

The website is live hosted on github pages [here](https://suneet-m.github.io/Restaurant-Reviews/).

## Starter Code
- I was provided the website started code which was completely buggy and wouldn't display correctly on any device size.
- The website lacked major accessibility features.
- Also the website would not work offline at all.

## Specification
- Incrementally convert the static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.
- The website should be responsive.
- Content should make use of available screen real estate and should display correctly at all screen sizes.
- Convert the website lacking accessibility, to be accessible by screen readers and other assisstive technology.
- Appropriate `ARIA` roles should be defined where necessary.
- Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page.
- Also add a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets for creating a seamless offline experience for users.
